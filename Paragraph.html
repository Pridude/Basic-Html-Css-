            HTML Paragraph
HTML paragraph or HTML p tag is used to define a paragraph in a webpage. Let's take a simple example to see how it work. It is a notable point that a browser itself add an empty line before and after a paragraph. An HTML <p> tag indicates starting of new paragraph.

Note: If we are using various <p> tags in one HTML file then browser automatically adds a single blank line between the two paragraphs.
See this example:

<p>This is first paragraph.</p>  
<p>This is second paragraph.</p>  
<p>This is third paragraph.</p>

Space inside HTML Paragraph
